    so far, the negamax is completely implementeed with che_terminal in place.
    it is still working with the dummy functions simple_heuristic(), get_moves(), apply_move().
    I am creating a branch to connect to gameutils.
    I will first replace get_valid_moves() and use apply_player_action() from game utils.
