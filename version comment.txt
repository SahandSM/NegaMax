    sahand: initiated adding the negamax.py file and other files along with it.

    so far, the negamax is completely implementeed with che_terminal in place.
    it is still working with the dummy functions simple_heuristic(), get_moves(), apply_move().
    I am creating a branch to connect to gameutils.
    I will first replace get_valid_moves() and use apply_player_action() from game utils.

    order_moves() was crashing in when agent was winning with next move.
    reason: the length of the pv[] was less than the length of depth-1 even at root node.
    lots of lines in order_moves() was unncessary.
    improved and corrected.
