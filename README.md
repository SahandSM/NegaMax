# Python Game AI Project

Welcome to the Connect 4 Game Agent Project, part of the TU Berlin Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and hosted by Dr. Felix Lundt in Wintersemester 23/24. In this project, students will implement a software agent capable of playing the classic game Connect 4. The project is divided into three main phases to guide your development:

## Project Phases

1. **Core Utility Functions (Weeks 1 & 2):** In this initial phase, your task is to implement the core utility functions necessary to play Connect 4. These functions should enable your agent to play against a human opponent.

2. **Basic Agent Design and Implementation:** Once the core utility functions are in place, you will design and implement a basic game-playing agent.

3. **Advanced Approaches (Rest of Semester, Possibly in Teams):** In this phase, you'll choose a more advanced approach for your agent's development. This could involve techniques such as gradient-based learning, reinforcement learning, or other sophisticated strategies. We aim to set up a tournament to evaluate how well your agents perform against each other.

## Project Guidelines

- At each phase of the project, it's crucial that your code is well-tested and well-documented. Make sure to maintain a high standard of code quality.

- Collaboration within each group should follow established software development processes, including issue tracking, setting milestones, and developing new features within dedicated repository branches, among other best practices.

## Course Objectives

The main objective of this course is to teach fundamental concepts of 'software carpentry,' which include:

- **Use of Version Control:** You will become proficient with version control systems like Git to manage your project's source code.

- **Basic Software Design Principles:** You'll learn and apply essential software design principles to create a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

- **Test-Driven Development:** Writing tests to validate your code's functionality and ensuring it remains robust throughout development.

- **Documentation:** Creating comprehensive documentation to help others understand and use your software.

- **Debugging, Profiling, and Optimization:** Developing skills in debugging, profiling, and optimizing your code for efficiency.
